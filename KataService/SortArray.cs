        //Your task is to write a function named “SortArray” that accepts an array of numbers. This function must return the array back but sorted in a way so that odd numbers are sorted in ascending order with the even numbers remaining in the same position. Zero isn't an odd number and as such doesn’t need to move. If you have an empty array, this needs to be returned as such.

        //Example
        //Input = [5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4] 
        //Output = [1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 4]

        public int[] SortArray(int[] input)
        {
            return input;
        }
    }
}
